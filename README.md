# Arduino Mini Projects 🛠️

Welcome to the **Arduino Mini Projects** repository! In this repo, I'll be adding a collection of small and fun Arduino projects. These projects are designed to be easy to follow and can be great for both beginners and enthusiasts looking to strengthen their foundational knowledge of Arduino. 🚀

### Projects Included:

1. **Data Logger (Temp, Humidity, and LDR)** 🌡️  
   A simple yet useful project that logs environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity (LDR), using Arduino. The data is then processed and visualized with Python. 📊

2. **Gesture-Controlled Volume** ✋  
   This project uses an ultrasonic sensor and PyAutoGUI to control your computer's volume based on hand gestures. It's a neat demonstration of how Arduino can interact with your computer via Python!

3. **OpenCV Capture through Arduino** 📸  
   This project integrates Arduino with OpenCV to capture an image when a specific signal is sent from Arduino. The Arduino sends a "Movement" signal with the help of the UltraSonic sensor to trigger the camera to take a picture using OpenCV, which is then saved and displayed. This project demonstrates how Arduino can be used to control computer peripherals like a camera!

4. **OTP Authentication with Arduino and Python** 🔑  
   This project involves a **One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication System** using Arduino and Python. When a button is pressed on the Arduino, it generates a time-based OTP using the RTC (Real-Time Clock) module and sends the OTP, along with the current Unix time and RTC time, to Python. Python then verifies the OTP and, if correct, launches a pre-configured application on your computer. This project combines Arduino hardware with Python’s OTP validation and subprocess handling to create a simple access control system.

   This is a very rudimentary application of the TOTP made just as a proof of concept.
